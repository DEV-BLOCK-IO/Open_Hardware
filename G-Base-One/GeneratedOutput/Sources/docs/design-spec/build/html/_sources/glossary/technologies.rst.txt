      `BibTeX`_ is a widely used bibliography management tool in |LaTeX|,
      with BibTeX the bibliography entries are kept in a separate file and
      then imported into the main document.

   :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`
      `CSS`_ is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
      of a document written in a markup language like |HTML|.
      :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)` is a cornerstone technology of the
      |WWW|, alongside |HTML| and |JavaScript|. In addition to |HTML|, other
      markup languages support the use of :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`
      including plain |XML| and |SVG|. The :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`
      specifications is standardized by the |W3C|/TR/CSS since 1996.

      displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
      |CSS| and scripting languages such as |JavaScript|.
      The :abbr:`HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)` specifications is
      standardized by the |W3C|/TR/HTML since 1997 and |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC34
      since 1998.

   :abbr:`PDF (Portable Document Format)`
      `PDF`_ is a file format developed by Adobe in 1993 to present documents,
      including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of
      application software, hardware, and operating systems. Based on the
      |PS| language, each :abbr:`PDF (Portable Document Format)` file
      encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document,
      including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other
      information needed to display it. :abbr:`PDF (Portable Document Format)`
      is standardized by the |ISO| TC171/SC2/WG8 since 2008, and no longer
      requires any royalties for its implementation.

      |ISO| standardized subsets of :abbr:`PDF (Portable Document Format)`:

   :abbr:`CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)`
   :abbr:`MOF (Meta-Object Facility)`
      `MOF`_ is an |OMG| standard for model-driven engineering. Its purpose
      is to provide a type system for entities in the |CORBA| architecture
      and a set of interfaces through which those types can be created and
      manipulated.

   :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)`
      `OCL`_ is a declarative language describing rules applying to |UML|
      models and is now part of the |UML| standard but as separate document.
      Initially, :abbr:`OCL (Object Constraint Language)` was merely a
      formal specification language extension for |UML|. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` may now be used with any |MOF| meta-model,
      including |UML|, and is a precise text language that provides constraint
      and object query expressions on any such kind of meta-model that cannot
      otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. :abbr:`OCL (Object
      Constraint Language)` is a key component of the new OMG standard
      recommendation for transforming models, the |QVT| specification.

   :abbr:`SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)`
     `SVG`_ is an |XML|-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics
     with support for interactivity and animation. The :abbr:`SVG (Scalable
     Vector Graphics)` specification is standardized by the |W3C|/TR/SVG since
     1999 as an open standard.

     :abbr:`SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)` drawings can be dynamic and
     interactive. Time-based modifications to the elements can be described in
     |SMIL|, or can be programmed in a scripting language (e.g. |ECMAScript| or
     |JavaScript|). The |W3C| explicitly recommends |SMIL| as the standard for
     animation in :abbr:`SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)`.

   :abbr:`SysML (Systems Modeling Language)`
   :abbr:`BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)`
   :abbr:`UML (Unified Modeling Language)`
      `UML`_ is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the
      field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard
      way to visualize the design of a system. In 1997, :abbr:`UML (Unified
      Modeling Language)` was adopted as a standard by the |OMG|, and has
      been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, :abbr:`UML
      (Unified Modeling Language)` was also published by |ISO| as an
      approved standard.

      In 2007 with the release of UML 2.1.2, two new significant
      specifications for certain technology areas have split off.
      These are: |SysML|, |BPMN|.

   TeX
      `TeX`_ is a computer language designed for use in typesetting system;
      in particular, for typesetting math and other technical material. It
      has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical
      systems and is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially
      in the form of |LaTeX|, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.

   :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`
      `XML`_ is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
      documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
      The design of :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)` focuses on
      documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary
      data structures. Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of
      :abbr:`XML (Extensible Markup Language)`-based languages. The :abbr:`XML
      (Extensible Markup Language)` specification is standardized by the
      |W3C|/TR/XML since 1998 as an open standard.
