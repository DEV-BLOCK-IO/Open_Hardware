   C
      `C`_ is a general-purpose, imperative procedural computer programming
      language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and
      recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to
      provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
      efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
      C has been standardized by the |ANSI| *X3J11* since 1989 (**ANSI C**) and
      by the |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22/WG14 (**ISO C**).

   C++
      `C++`_ is a general-purpose programming language as an extension of the
      |C| programming language, or *"C with Classes"*. Modern C++ implementations
      now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
      facilities for low-level memory manipulation. C++ is standardized by the
      |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22/WG14 since 1998.

   :abbr:`ES (ECMAScript)`
   ECMAScript
      :abbr:`ES (ECMAScript)` is a general-purpose programming language,
      standardized by `Ecma International`_ since 1997 according to the
      document `ECMA-262`_. It is a |JavaScript| standard meant to ensure
      the interoperability of Web pages across different Web browsers.
      :abbr:`ES (ECMAScript)` is standardized by the |ISO|/|IEC| JTC1/SC22
      since 1998.

   :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)`
   JavaScript
      :abbr:`JS (JavaScript)` is a programming language that conforms to the
      |ECMAScript| specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
      compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
      typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      Alongside |HTML| and |CSS|, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
      of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
      an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
      it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

   Python
      `Python`_ is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming
      language. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
      A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free
      and open-source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the
      Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and
      CPython development.

      CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in |C|,
      meeting the |C|\ 89 standard with several select |C|\ 99 features.
      Python's development is conducted largely through the |PEP| process, the
      primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community
      input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding
      style is covered in :pep:`8`.
