      community for technical documentation. It is part of the |Docutils|
      project of the |Python| Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group).

   Sphinx
      `Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator written and used by the |Python|
      community. It is written in |Python|, and also used in other environments.
      Sphinx converts |reStructuredText| files into |HTML| websites and other
      formats including PDF, EPub, Texinfo and man.

      |reStructuredText| is extensible, and Sphinx exploits its extensible
      nature through a number of extensions |--| for auto generating
      documentation from source code, writing mathematical notation
      or highlighting source code, etc.

   LaTeX
      `LaTeX`_ is a document preparation system for high-quality
      typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical
      or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form
      of publishing. LaTeX uses the |TeX| typesetting program for
      formatting its output, and is itself written in the |TeX| macro
      language.

      styles and produces byte-identical output. Additionally, Pybtex is
      Unicode aware and Pybtex supports `bibliography formats`_ other than
